# Prototype Based Mapping Functions

This repository provides the scripts for reproducing the results given in my thesis.


# Required packages

All our codes are implemented in Pyhton 3.9 and we use the following packages:

   1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org)
   2. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
   3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is required to only reproduce the given figures.
    
# Tutorials

[Tutorial](./Tutorial.ipynb) initially explains the implementation of mapping functions, subsequently providing two instances of their utilization within scikit-learn tools, such as pipeline and grid-search.

# Reproducing our results

We provide the following scripts to reproduce our results.

* Repoducing the results related classification: [Numerical_Experiment_Run.py](./Numerical_Experiment_Run.py) 

* Repoducing the results related regression: [Regression_Experiment_Run.py](./Regression_Experiment_Run.py)
