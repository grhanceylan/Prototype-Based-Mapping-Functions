# Prototype Based Mapping Functions

This repository provides the scripts for reproducing the results given in my thesis.


# Required packages

All our codes are implemented in Pyhton 3.9 and we use the following packages:

   1. [Numpy](https://numpy.org)
   2. [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
   3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is required to only reproduce the given figures.
    
# Tutorials

[Tutorial](./FeatureMaps.ipynb) explains the general usage of the mapping functions with scikit-learn 


# Reproducing our results

We provide the following scripts to reproduce results that we have reported in our paper.

* [Table_1_Run.py](./Table_1_Run.py)

* [Table_2_3_Run.py](./Table_2_3_Run.py)

* [Figure_3_Run.py](./ApproxSklearn.py) Eklenecek
